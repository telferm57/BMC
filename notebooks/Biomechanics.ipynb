This classification is clear; dynamics is the study of the motions of bodies and Statics is the study of forces in the absence of changes in motion. Kinematics is the study of motion without considering its possible causes (forces) and Kinetics is the study of the possible causes of motion. "

    "Nevertheless, it's common in Biomechanics to adopt a slightly different classification: to partition it between Kinematics and Kinetics, and then Kinetics into Statics and Dynamics (David Winter, Nigg & Herzog, and Vladimir Zatsiorsky, among others, use this classification in their books). The rationale is that we first separate the study of motion considering or not its causes (forces). The partition of (Bio)Mechanics in this way is useful because is simpler to study and describe (measure) the kinematics of human motion and then go to the more complicated issue of understanding (measuring) the forces related to the human motion.\n",

    "Anyway, these different classifications reveal a certain contradiction between Mechanics (particularly from an engineering point of view) and Biomechanics; some scholars will say that this taxonomy in Biomechanics is simply wrong and it should be corrected to align with the Mechanics.

    "## Problems\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Go to [Biomechanics Classes on the Web](http://pages.uoregon.edu/karduna/biomechanics/) to visit websites of biomechanics classes around the world and find out how biomechanics is studied in different fields.  \n",
    "2. Find examples of applications of biomechanics in different areas.  \n",
    "3. Watch the video [The Weird World of Eadweard Muybridge](http://youtu.be/5Awo-P3t4Ho) to learn about [Eadweard Muybridge](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eadweard_Muybridge), an important person to the development of instrumentation for biomechanics.  \n",
    "4. Think about practical problems in nature that can be studied in biomechanics with simple approaches (simple modeling and low-tech methods) or very complicated approaches (complex modeling and high-tech methods).  \n",
    "5. What the study in the biomechanics of athletes, children, elderlies, persons with disabilities, other animals, and computer animation for the cinema industry may have in common and different?  \n",
    "6. Visit the website of the Laboratory of Biomechanics and Motor Control at UFABC and find out what we do and if there is anything you are interested in.  \n",
    "7. Is there anything in biomechanics that interests you? How could you pursue this interest? "
